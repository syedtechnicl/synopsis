<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Based on the requirements of a system, varying user may have different CRUD cycles. A customer may use CRUD to create an account and access that account when returning to a particular site. The user may then update personal data or change billing information. On the other hand, an operations manager might create product records, then call them when needed or modify line items.

During the Web 2.0 era, CRUD operations were at the foundation of most dynamic websites. However, you should differentiate CRUD from the HTTP action verbs. For example, if you want to create a new record you should use “POST.” To update a record, you would use “PUT” or “PATCH.” If you wanted to delete a record, you would use “DELETE.” Through CRUD, users and administrators had the access rights to edit, delete, create or browse online records.

An application designer has many options for executing CRUD operations. One of the most efficient of choices is to create a set of stored procedures in SQL to execute operations. With regard to CRUD stored procedures, here are a few common naming conventions:

The procedure name should end with the implemented name of the CRUD operation. The prefix should not be the same as the prefix used for other user-defined stored procedures.
CRUD procedures for the same table will be grouped together if you use the table name after the prefix.
After adding CRUD procedures, you can update the database schema by identifying the database entity where CRUD operations will be implemented.</p>

<center><h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;text-decoration:underline;">CRUD OPERATION<br></h1>
<p>CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. CRUD operations are basic data manipulation for database. We've already learned how to perform create (i.e. insert), read (i.e. select), update and delete operations in previous chapters. In this tutorial we'll create a simple PHP application to perform all these operations on a MySQL database table at one place.

Well, let's start by creating the table which we'll use in all of our example.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;">create</h1>
<p>Create allows you to add new rows to your table. You can do that using the command, INSERT INTO. The command starts with the INSERT INTO keyword, followed by the table name, column names, and the values to be inserted.

When using INSERT INTO, you have two options

In the example below, we will add data to our bakery table.</p>

<br>
<h1 style="text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;">read</h1>
<p>The read function is similar to a search function, as it allows you to retrieve specific records and read their values. Read refers to SELECT

For example, let’s take a look at the items we sell at our bakery. To do that, we have to display all the data in our menu table using:

When using INSERT INTO, you have two options

In the example below, we will add data to our bakery table.This will not make any changes to the menu table but will simply display all the records in that table.

Take a look at this example to see how SELECT retrieves desired data:</p>
<br>

<h1 style="text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;">update</h1>
<p>Update is how we change an existing record in the table. We can use this to modify existing records that exist in the database. When performing UPDATE, you need to define the target table and columns to be updated. You also need the associated values and sometimes the rows.

To update an existing record, use the following:

UPDATE table_collage
 SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
 WHERE condition;

</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;">delete</h1>
<p>Delete is used to remove a record from the table. SQL and has a built-in delete function for deleting one or more records from the database at a time. Some relational database applications may permit a hard delete (permanent delete) or soft delete (update row status).

The delete command is as follows:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
</p>
